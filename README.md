# Predictive-Modeling-of-User-Churn-in-Waze

Developed a predictive model to identify users likely to churn from Waze, a community-based traffic and navigation app, to help improve user retention strategies. The dataset comprised total number of drives, driving days, app usage patterns, and historical churn data. Cleaned data, handled missing values, and engineered features such as km per driving day, percent sessions in the last month, total sessions per day, km per hour, and km per drive. Visualized distributions, relationships, and identified key features. Some of the insights noted were that distance driven per driving day had a positive correlation with user churn; the farther a user drove on each driving day, the more likely they were to churn. Conversely, the number of driving days had a negative correlation with churn; users who drove more days in the last month were less likely to churn. Applied hypothesis testing to gain business insights and found that drivers who use iPhone devices on average have a similar number of drives as those who use Android devices. Built random forest and XGBoost models, but the models didnâ€™t have good predictive values due to low recall scores. However, if the model is only being used to guide further exploratory efforts, then it can still have value.
